### 🧮 Java Calculator App

A simple calculator application built entirely in **Java** using **Java Swing** for the UI. I spent a chill day building this for fun because my hands were too idle 😅 — but it turned out better than expected!

This calculator mimics the classic **Casio fx-100MS** layout, and supports:

### ✨ Features

* Basic arithmetic operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
* Function support for:

  * `sin`, `cos`, `tan` (degree input)
  * `log`, `ln`
  * `x²`, `√`, `x^y`
* Expression evaluation with **parentheses**
* Memory save and recall (M+ and Ans)
* Rounded results (up to 4 decimal places)
* GUI styled with a **modern gray theme** in Swing

### 🧠 What's next?

This is just version 1.0 — planning to:

* Add keyboard input support
* Make more functions work (`hyp`, `ENG`, `a b/c`)
* Create a better layout (like fx-991EX maybe? 😄)
